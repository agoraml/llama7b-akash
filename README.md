# agora-mlops

Agora is an end-to-end MLOps platform built on decentralized computing networks. With the recent AI/ML boom, GPU compute has been in short supply for engineers everywhere - furthermore, centralized cloud entities that control much of the hardware available engage in price gouging and monopolistic behaviors. This demand will only exponentially increase in the coming years.

Decentralized computing networks offer cheaper, ubiquitous access to compute by tapping into untapped public supply. These open-source networks will scale quickly in the coming years as they onboard suppliers around the world. However, with web3 friction points and the lack of familiar, robust infrastructure to deploy on these networks, AI/ML engineers cannot take advantage of this untapped source for compute. Agora will bridge this gap.

We are currently focused on building an end-to-end fine-tuning pipeline for open-source models such as LlAma-2 and Stable Diffusion XL, completely powered by decentralized compute. We want to focus early iterations of our infra for high-growth startups and projects that are facing cost-constrained compute budgets, as well as open-source AI/ML engineers who want to take advantage of alternative sources for compute. Feel free to reach out to us if you are intrigued by our vision.
